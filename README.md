# Front-End Resources

A collection of free front-end, JavaScript-centric, resources. I recommend starting with this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) 💜. You'll often see Udemy courses being recommended, and while I'm sure they're great, they cost money and there seems to be plenty of great free material out there so I won't bother mentioning them here. I'm a big fan of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 💜, but I'm a bit lost as to how best to navigate their resources a lot of the time. Regardless, it's still worth checking for any up-to-date guides.

## React
A JavaScript library used to produce HTML from dynamic components. Start with the updated [docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) 💜! After, you might want to consider looking in to frameworks, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 

#### Setup
- [Vite Official](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- my own [guide](/vite.md); **note** these instructions are for Vue but the setup for React is generally the same
But what about `Create React App`? Read [this](https://scrimba.com/articles/create-react-app-with-vite/) for why you might want to use Vite instead. 

#### Learning Resources
* [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) • ~11+ hrs 💜
* [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) • ~2 ½ <br>
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) <br>

#### Suggested Projects
* [Portfolio](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) 💜

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

### Hotwire
Turbo and Stimulus, if you're prefer to stick with something more Rails-y.

#### Learning Resources
* [Hotrails](https://www.hotrails.dev/)
* Odin Project [Turbo Drive](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-turbo-drive) and [Turbo](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-turbo) pages 💜

## Vanilla JavaScript
Just remember, you'll eventually want to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) but it's worth getting comfortable with JS first. 

#### Learning Resources
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

#### Technical Questions
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) 💜
* Get comfortable with technical assessment sites like Code Signal, [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) and [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/) that are used by larger companies.

#### Please explain ... 🚧
* [classes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-classes-how-they-work-with-use-case/#what-are-classes-in-javascript)
* [time to interactive](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/)
* [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) • Video 💜

## Blogs
* [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) 💜
> fantastically well explained tutorials, I can't recommend them enough (just be sure to check whether they've been updated recently)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

## Other

Start learning about and using 💜 [Docker](https://github.com/acantril/docker-fundamentals)! The official tutorial is also a great place to start. 

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

## Computer Science

A contentious topic for Bootcamp graduates, and one I'm not well qualified to talk about. The general consensus (i.e. what Reddit says) seems to be that there several important concepts to learn with [some](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) being more important than others. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is probably a good place to start. Something more [targeted](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/) might a better use of one's time, however. There's also plenty of nice [free stuff](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) of course.
